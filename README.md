# quark-perms
A complete permissions plugin, equipped with a handy API

Note from developer:
While this repository is public, this is in early development and there is heavy work going into this project. Expect bugs and lots of changes as I actively build the functionality of this plugin. Current stable build is DEV-1.2


Changelog:
30/10/20 | Added info permissions, added support for offline players, pushed other QOL changes
